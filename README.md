Life Expectancy Data Analysis
This project analyzes the World Health Organization (WHO) life expectancy dataset to uncover insights into the factors affecting life expectancy globally. Using data from 193 countries (2000-2015), it explores health and economic indicators through data preprocessing, transformation, and visualization.

Project Steps
Data Preprocessing:

Addressed missing values for key columns like Life Expectancy, GDP, and Population.
Cleaned data by removing errors, duplicates, and outliers.
Data Transformation:

Normalized economic and health indicators for consistency.
Encoded categorical data (e.g., Developed/Developing status).
Created new features, such as continent mapping and BMI categorization.
Data Analysis & Visualization:

Performed statistical analysis using Python.
Visualized trends and relationships using Power BI dashboards.
